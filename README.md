# OWL-Ontology
An OWL Ontology: A Commercial  Catalogue Of Adult Products

For the scope of this course, a simple-structured ontology is constructed and populated in Protégé environment. Based on knowledge and research, the decisions about which relationships and 
properties could be applied will be taken. Based on the conception of the Web as an Open World, where new information could come to light at any time, inferred information, as depicted by the 
inferred hierarchy, is being presented. The project's goal is an inferred hierarchy, computed by the reasoner, that differs from the asserted one because new knowledge is inferred. These new 
connections provide the ability to prove the consistency of that information or to convert verifiable information to unequivocal. The main concern of this project is to make a well-structured ontology, 
after a cautious definition of the following mentioning components of the sex shop ontology as follows:
<ul> Determine the domain (e-shop products)
<ul> Define classes & class hierarchy
<ul> Define properties of these classes
<ul> Create instances (i.e., individuals)
Since all data are pre-linked in the ontology, efficient information retrieval via the RDF query language SPARQL is being conducted in the end. The appraisal of the connected data structure 
will be based upon the capacity to precisely act for the data self-assuredly and the capacity to create the specified inductions.
